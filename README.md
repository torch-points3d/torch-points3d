This is a framework for running common deep learning models for point cloud analysis tasks against classic benchmark. It heavily relies on [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/resources.html) and [Facebook Hydra](https://hydra.cc/).

The framework allows lean and yet complex model to be built with minimum effort and great reproducibility.
It also provide a high level API to democratize deep learning on pointclouds.
See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04642.pdf) at 3DV for an overview of the framework capacities and benchmarks of state-of-the-art networks.

- segmentation
- classification
- registration
- object_detection
- panoptic

where each folder contains the dataset related to each task.

# 3D Sparse convolution support

We currently support [Minkowski Engine](https://github.com/StanfordVL/MinkowskiEngine) > v0.5 and [torchsparse](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchsparse) as backends for sparse convolutions. Those packages need to be installed independently from Torch Points3d, please follow installation instructions and troubleshooting notes on the respective repositories. At the moment `torchsparse` demonstrates faster training and inference on GPU but comes with limited functionalities. For example, `MinkowskiEngine` can be used **Please be aware that `torchsparse` is still in beta and does not support CPU processing only for example.**

Once you have setup one of those two sparse convolution framework you can start using are high level to define a unet backbone or simply an encoder:

```python
from torch_points3d.applications.sparseconv3d import SparseConv3d

model = SparseConv3d("unet", input_nc=3, output_nc=5, num_layers=4, backbone="torchsparse") # minkowski by default
```

You can also assemble your own networks by using the modules provided in `torch_points3d/modules/SparseConv3d/nn`. For example if you wish to use `torchsparse` backend you can do the following:

```python
import torch_points3d.modules.SparseConv3d as sp3d

sp3d.nn.set_backend("torchsparse")
conv = sp3d.nn.Conv3d(10, 10)
bn = sp3d.nn.BatchNorm(10)
```

# Adding your model to the PretrainedRegistry.

The `PretrainedRegistry` enables anyone to add their own pre-trained models and `re-create` them with only 2 lines of code for `finetunning` or `production` purposes.

- `[You]` Launch your model training with [Wandb](https://www.wandb.com) activated (`wandb.log=True`)
- `[TorchPoints3d]` Once the training finished, `TorchPoints3d` will upload your trained model within [our custom checkpoint](https://app.wandb.ai/nicolas/scannet/runs/1sd84bf1) to your wandb.
- `[You]` Within [`PretainedRegistry`](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/torch_points3d/applications/pretrained_api.py#L31) class, add a `key-value pair` within its attribute `MODELS`. The `key` should be describe your model, dataset and training hyper-parameters (possibly the best model), the `value` should be the `url` referencing the `.pt` file on your wandb.

Example: Key: `pointnet2_largemsg-s3dis-1` and URL value: `https://api.wandb.ai/files/loicland/benchmark-torch-points-3d-s3dis/1e1p0csk/pointnet2_largemsg.pt` for the `pointnet2_largemsg.pt` file.
The key desribes a `pointnet2 largemsg trained on s3dis fold 1`.

- `[Anyone]` By using the `PretainedRegistry` class and by providing the `key`, the associated model weights will be `downloaded` and the pre-trained model will be `ready to use` with its transforms.

```python
[In]:
from torch_points3d.applications.pretrained_api import PretainedRegistry

model = PretainedRegistry.from_pretrained("pointnet2_largemsg-s3dis-1")

print(model.wandb)
print(model.print_transforms())

# Developer guidelines

## Setting repo

We use [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) for managing our packages.
In order to get started, clone this repositories and run the following command from the root of the repo

```
poetry install --no-root
```

This will install all required dependencies in a new virtual environment.

Activate the environment

```bash
poetry shell
```

You can check that the install has been successful by running

```bash
python -m unittest -v
```

For `pycuda` support (only needed for the registration tasks):

```bash
pip install pycuda
```

## Getting started: Train pointnet++ on part segmentation task for dataset shapenet

```bash
poetry run python train.py task=segmentation model_type=pointnet2 model_name=pointnet2_charlesssg dataset=shapenet-fixed
```

And you should see something like that

The [config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/master/conf/models/segmentation/pointnet2.yaml) for pointnet++ is a good example of how to define a model and is as follow:

## Inference

### Inference script

We provide a script for running a given pre trained model on custom data that may not be annotated. You will find an [example](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/forward_scripts/forward.py) of this for the part segmentation task on Shapenet. Just like for the rest of the codebase most of the customization happens through config files and the provided example can be extended to other datasets. You can also easily create your own from there. Going back to the part segmentation task, say you have a folder full of point clouds that you know are Airplanes, and you have the checkpoint of a model trained on Airplanes and potentially other classes, simply edit the [config.yaml](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/forward_scripts/conf/config.yaml) and [shapenet.yaml](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/forward_scripts/conf/dataset/shapenet.yaml) and run the following command:

```bash
python forward_scripts/forward.py
```

The result of the forward run will be placed in the specified `output_folder` and you can use the [notebook](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/forward_scripts/notebooks/viz_shapenet.ipynb) provided to explore the results. Below is an example of the outcome of using a model trained on caps only to find the parts of airplanes and caps.

![resexplore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/master/docs/imgs/inference_demo.gif)

### Containerizing your model with Docker

Finally, for people interested in deploying their models to production environments, we provide a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) as well as a [build script](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/docker/build.sh). Say you have trained a network for semantic segmentation that gave the weight `<outputfolder/weights.pt>`, the following command will build a docker image for you:

```bash
cd docker
./build.sh outputfolder/weights.pt
```

You can then use it to run a forward pass on a all the point clouds in `input_path` and generate the results in `output_path`

```bash
docker run -v /test_data:/in -v /test_data/out:/out pointnet2_charlesssg:latest python3 forward_scripts/forward.py dataset=shapenet data.forward_category=Cap input_path="/in" output_path="/out"
```

The `-v` option mounts a local directory to the container's file system. For example in the command line above, `/test_data/out` will be mounted at the location `/out`. As a consequence, all files written in `/out` will be available in the folder `/test_data/out` on your machine.

## Profiling

We advice to use [`snakeviz`](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) and [`cProfile`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html)

Use cProfile to profile your code

```
poetry run python -m cProfile -o {your_name}.prof train.py ... debugging.profiling=True
```

And visualize results using snakeviz.

```
snakeviz {your_name}.prof
```

It is also possible to use [`torch.utils.bottleneck`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/bottleneck.html)

```
python -m torch.utils.bottleneck /path/to/source/script.py [args]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot compile certain CUDA Kernels or seg faults while running the tests

Ensure that at least PyTorch 1.4.0 is installed and verify that `cuda/bin` and `cuda/include` are in your `$PATH` and `$CPATH` respectively, e.g.:

```
$ python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
>>> 1.4.0

$ echo $PATH
>>> /usr/local/cuda/bin:...

$ echo $CPATH
>>> /usr/local/cuda/include:...
```

### Undefined symbol / Updating Pytorch

When we update the version of Pytorch that is used, the compiled packages need to be reinstalled, otherwise you will run into an error that looks like this:

```
... scatter_cpu.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3c1012CUDATensorIdEv
```

This can happen for the following libraries:

- torch-points-kernels
- torch-scatter
- torch-cluster
- torch-sparse

An easy way to fix this is to run the following command with the virtual env activated:

```
pip uninstall torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-points-kernels -y
rm -rf ~/.cache/pip
poetry install
```

### CUDA kernel failed : no kernel image is available for execution on the device

This can happen when trying to run the code on a different GPU than the one used to compile the `torch-points-kernels` library. Uninstall `torch-points-kernels`, clear cache, and reinstall after setting the `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` environment variable. For example, for compiling with a Tesla T4 (Turing 7.5) and running the code on a Tesla V100 (Volta 7.0) use:

```

### Cannot use wandb on Windows

Raises `OSError: [WinError 6] The handle is invalid` / `wandb: ERROR W&B process failed to launch`
Wandb is currently broken on Windows (see [this issue](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/862)), a workaround is to use the command line argument `wandb.log=false`

# Exploring your experiments

We provide a [notebook](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/notebooks/dashboard.ipynb) based [pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) and [panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) that allows you to explore your past experiments visually. When using jupyter lab you will have to install an extension:

```
jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
```

Run through the notebook and you should see a dashboard starting that looks like the following:

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The only asks are that you stick to the styling and that you add tests as you add more features!

For styling you can use [pre-commit hooks](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/) to help you:

```
pre-commit install
```

A sequence of checks will be run for you and you may have to add the fixed files again to the stashed files.

When it comes to docstrings we use [numpy style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) docstrings, for those who use
Visual Studio Code, there is a great [extension](https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring) that can help with that. Install it and set the format to numpy and you should be good to go!

Finaly, if you want to have a direct chat with us feel free to join our slack, just shoot us an email and we'll add you.
