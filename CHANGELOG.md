and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.1.0

### Added

- Support scannet test dataset and automatic generation of submission files using the eval.py script
- Full res predictions on Scannet with voting
- VoteNet model and losses
- Tracker for object detection
- Models can specify which attributes they need from the data in order to forward and train properly
- Full res predictions on ShapeNet with voting
- Trainer class to handle train / eval
- Add testing for Trainer:
  - Segmentation: PointNet2 on cap ShapeNet
  - Segmentation: KPConv on scannetV2
  - Object Detection: VoteNet on scannetV2
- Add VoteNet Paper / Backbones within API
- Windows support
- Weights are uploaded to wandb at the end of the run
- Added PointGroup https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01294.pdf
- Added PretrainedRegistry allowing model weight to be downloaded directly from wandb and DatasetMocking
- Added script for s3dis cross-validation [scripts/cv_s3dis.py]. 6 different pretrained models will be downloaded, evaluated on full resolution and confusion matrice will be summed to get all metrics.

### Changed

- evaluation output folder is now a subfolder of the checkpoint it uses
- saves model checkpoints to wandb
- GridSampling3D now creates a new attribute `coords` that stores the non quantized position when the transform is called in `quantize` mode
- cuda parameter can be given in command line to select the GPU to use
- Updated to pytorch geometric 1.6.0

### Bugfix

- ElasticDistortion transform is now fully functional

### Removed

## 1.0.1

### Changed

- We now support the latest PyTorch
- Migration to the latest PyTorch Geometric and dependencies

### Bugfixes

- #273 (support python 3.7)

## 0.2.2

### Bugfix

- Pre transform is being overriden by the inference transform

## 0.2.1

### Added

- Customizable number of channels at the output of the API models
- API models expose output number of channels as a property
- Added Encoder to the API
- Sampled ModelNet dataset for point clouds
