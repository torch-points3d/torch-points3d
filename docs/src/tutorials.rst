Create a new dataset
-----------------------

Let's add support for the version of `S3DIS <http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html>`_ that **Pytorch Geometric** provides:
https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html#torch_geometric.datasets.S3DIS

We are going to go through the successive steps to do so:

    :depth: 1


Let's go through those steps together and in order to go further we highly recommend that you take a look at Before starting, we strongly advice to read the `Creating Your Own Datasets <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/create_dataset.html>`_ from **Pytorch Geometric**.

Create a dataset that the framework recognises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The framework provides a base class for datasets that needs to be sub classed when you add your own. 
We also follow the convention that the ``.py`` file that describes a dataset for segmentation will leave in the ``torch_points3d/datasets/segmentation`` folder.
For another task such as classification it would go in ``torch_points3d/datasets/classification``. 

Start by creating a new file ``torch_points3d/datasets/segmentation/s3dis.py`` with the class ``S3DISDataset``, it should inherit from ``BaseDataset``.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from torch_geometric.datasets import S3DIS

    from torch_points3d.datasets.base_dataset import BaseDataset
    from torch_points3d.metrics.segmentation_tracker import SegmentationTracker

    class S3DISDataset(BaseDataset):
        def __init__(self, dataset_opt):
            super().__init__(dataset_opt)

            self.train_dataset = S3DIS(
                self._data_path,
                test_area=self.dataset_opt.fold,
                train=True,
                pre_transform=self.pre_transform,
                transform=self.train_transform,
            )
            self.test_dataset = S3DIS(
                self._data_path,
                test_area=self.dataset_opt.fold,
                train=False,
                pre_transform=self.pre_transform,
                transform=self.test_transform,
            )


        @staticmethod
        def get_tracker(model, dataset, wandb_log: bool, tensorboard_log: bool):
            """Factory method for the tracker

            Arguments:
                dataset {[type]}
                wandb_log - Log using weight and biases
            Returns:
                [BaseTracker] -- tracker
            """
            return SegmentationTracker(dataset, wandb_log=wandb_log, use_tensorboard=tensorboard_log)

Let's explain the code more in details there.

.. code-block:: python

   class S3DISDataset(BaseDataset):
        def __init__(self, dataset_opt):
            super().__init__(dataset_opt)

This instantiates the parent class based on a given configuration ``dataset_opt`` (see :ref:`config_ref`) and this does few things for you:

* Sets the path to the data, by convention it will be ``dataset_opt.dataroot/s3dis/`` in our case (name of the class without Dataset)
* Extracts from the configuration the transforms that should be applied to you data before giving it to the model


Next comes the instantiation of the actual datasets that will be used for training and testing. 

.. code-block:: python

        self.train_dataset = S3DIS(
            self._data_path,
            test_area=self.dataset_opt.fold,
            train=True,
            pre_transform=self.pre_transform,
            transform=self.train_transform,
        )
        self.test_dataset = S3DIS(
            self._data_path,
            test_area=self.dataset_opt.fold,
            train=False,
            pre_transform=self.pre_transform,
            transform=self.test_transform,
        )

You can see that we use the ``pre_transform``, ``test_transform`` and ``train_transform`` from the base class, they have been set based on the configuration 
that you have provided. The base class will then use those datasets to create the dataloaders that will be used in the training script. 

The final step is to associate a metric tracker to your dataset, in this case we will use a SegmentationTracker that tracks IoU metrics as well as accuracy, mean accuracy and loss.

.. code-block:: python

       @staticmethod
        def get_tracker(model, dataset, wandb_log: bool, tensorboard_log: bool):
            """Factory method for the tracker

            Arguments:
                dataset {[type]}
                wandb_log - Log using weight and biases
            Returns:
                [BaseTracker] -- tracker
            """
            return SegmentationTracker(dataset, wandb_log=wandb_log, use_tensorboard=tensorboard_log)


.. _config_ref:

Create a new configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's move to the next step, the definition of the configuration file that will control the behaviour of our dataset. The configuration file mainly controls the following things:

* Location of the data
* Transforms that will be applied to the data
* Python class that will be used for creating the actual python object used during training. 

Let's create a ``conf/data/segmentation/s3disfused.yaml`` file with our own setting to setup the dataset

.. literalinclude:: ../../conf/data/segmentation/s3disfused.yaml
   :language: yaml

.. note:: 
 * ``task`` needs to be specified. Currently, the arguments provided by the command line are lost and therefore we need the extra information.
 * ``class`` needs to be specified. In that case, since we solve a classification task, the code will look for a class named ``S3DISDataset`` within the ``torch_points3d/datasets/segmentation/s3dis.py`` file.

For more details about the tracker please refer to the `source code <https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/torch_points3d/metrics/segmentation_tracker.py>`_

Create a new model
--------------------

Let's add `PointNet++ <https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2>`_ model implemented within the "DENSE" format type to the project. 
Model definitions are separated between the definition of the core "convolution" operation equivalent to a Conv2D on images (see :ref:`module_ref`) and the overall model that combines all those convolutions (see :ref:`model_ref`).


We are going to go through the successive steps to do so:

.. contents::

   :depth: 1

.. _module_ref:

Create the basic modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Let's create ``torch_points3d/modules/pointnet2/`` directory and ``dense.py`` file within.

.. note::
 Remember to create a ``__init__.py`` file within that directory that will contain the multiscale convolution proposed in pointnet++.

.. literalinclude:: ../../torch_points3d/modules/pointnet2/dense.py
   :language: python


Let's dig in.

.. code-block:: python

   class PointNetMSGDown(BaseDenseConvolutionDown):
       def __init__(
           ...
       ):
           super(PointNetMSGDown, self).__init__(
               DenseFPSSampler(num_to_sample=npoint), DenseRadiusNeighbourFinder(radii, nsample), **kwargs
           )


* The ``PointNetMSGDown`` inherit from ``BaseDenseConvolutionDown``:
  
  * ``BaseDenseConvolutionDown`` takes care of all the sampling and search logic for you.
  * Therefore, a ``sampler`` and a ``neighbour finder`` have to be provided.
  * Here, we provide ``DenseFPSSampler`` (furthest point sampling) and ``DenseRadiusNeighbourFinder`` (neighbour search within a given radius)

* The ``PointNetMSGDown`` class just needs to implement the ``conv`` method which implements the actual logic for deriving the features that will come out of this layer. Here the features of a given point are obtained by passing the neighbours of that point through an MLP.

.. _model_ref:

Assemble all the basic blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's create a new file ``/torch_points3d/models/segmentation/pointnet2.py`` with its associated class 
``PointNet2_D``

.. code-block:: python

   import torch

   import torch.nn.functional as F
   from torch_geometric.data import Data
   import logging

   from torch_points3d.modules.pointnet2 import * # This part is extremely important. Always important the associated modules within your this file

           - define loss function, visualization images, model names, and optimizers
           """
           UnetBasedModel.__init__(
               self, option, model_type, dataset, modules
           )  # call the initialization method of UnetBasedModel

           # Create the mlp to classify data
           nn = option.mlp_cls.nn

           data = data.to(device)
           self.input = data
           self.labels = data.y
           self.batch_idx = torch.arange(0, data.pos.shape[0]).view(-1, 1).repeat(1, data.pos.shape[1]).view(-1)

       def forward(self) -> Any:
           """Run forward pass. This will be called by both functions <optimize_parameters> and <test>."""
           data = self.model(self.input)

           self.loss_seg.backward()  # calculate gradients of network G w.r.t. loss_G

.. note::

    * Make sure that you import all the required modules
    * You need to inherit from ``BaseModel``. That class contains all the core logic that enables training (see `base_model.py <https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/torch_points3d/models/base_model.py>`_ for more details)

Create a new configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We create a new file ``conf/models/segmentation/pointnet2.yaml``.
This file will contain all the **different versions** of pointnet++.

.. literalinclude:: ../../conf/models/segmentation/pointnet2.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 1,87-122

Here is ``PointNet++`` Multi-Scale original version by `Charles R. Qi <https://github.com/charlesq34>`_.

Let's dig in the definition.


**Required arguments**

* 
  ``pointnet2_charlesmsg`` is model_name and should be provided from the command line in order to load this file configuration.

* 
  ``architecture: pointnet2.PointNet2_D``. It indicates where to find the Model Logic.
  The framework backend will look for the file ``/torch_points3d/models/segmentation/pointnet2.py`` and the ``PointNet2_D`` class.

* 
  ``conv_type: "DENSE"``


**"Optional" arguments**


When I say optional, I mean those parameters could be defined differently for your own model.
We don't want to force any particular configuration format however, the simpler is always better !

The format above is used across models that leverage our  `Unet architecture <https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597>`_ builder base class 
`torch_points3d/models/base_architectures/unet.py <https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/torch_points3d/models/base_architectures/unet.py>`_ 
with ``UnetBasedModel`` and ``UnwrappedUnetBasedModel``.
The following arguments are required by those classes:

* ``down_conv``: parameters of each down convolution layer
* ``innermost``: parameters of the innermost layer
* ``up_conv``: parameters of each up convolution layer

Those elements need to contain a ``module_name`` which will be used to create the associated Module.

Those Unet builder classes will do the followings:

* If provided a list, it will use the index to access the value
* If provided something else, it will broadcast the arguments to all convolutions.

**Understanding the model**

From the configuration written above, we can infer that

- The model has got two down convolutions, one inner module and three up convolutions
- Each down convolutions is a multiscale pointnet++ convolution implemented with the class ``PointNetMSGDown``
- The first down convolution uses the following parameters:

    - only 512 points are kept after this layer,
    - three scales with radii 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 are used,
    - 32, 64 and 128 neighbours are kept for each scale
    - the multi layer perceptrons for each scale are of size: [FEAT+3, 32, 32, 64], [FEAT+3, 64, 64, 128] and [FEAT+3, 64, 96, 128] respectively
- The up convolution uses ``DenseFPModule`` and the first layer has got an MLP of size  [1024 + 256*2, 256, 256]
- The final classifier has got two layers and uses a dropout of 0.5

Another example with RSConcv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here is an example with the ``RSConv`` implementation in ``MESSAGE_TYPE ConvType``.

.. code-block:: python

   class RSConv(BaseConvolutionDown):
       def __init__(self, ratio=None, radius=None, local_nn=None, down_conv_nn=None, *args, **kwargs):
           super(RSConv, self).__init__(FPSSampler(ratio), RadiusNeighbourFinder(radius), *args, **kwargs)

           self._conv = Convolution(local_nn=local_nn, global_nn=down_conv_nn)

       def conv(self, x, pos, edge_index, batch):
           return self._conv(x, pos, edge_index)

We can see this convolution needs the followings arguments

.. code-block:: python

   ratio=None, radius=None, local_nn=None, down_conv_nn=None

Here is an extract from the model architecture config:

.. code-block:: yaml

   down_conv: # For the encoder part convolution
       module_name: RSConv # We will be using the RSConv Module

       # And provide to each convolution, the associated arguments within a list are selected using the convolution index.
       # For the others, there are just copied for each convolution.
       activation:
           name:  "LeakyReLU"
           negative_slope: 0.2
       ratios: [0.2, 0.25] 
       radius: [0.1, 0.2]
       local_nn: [[10, 8, FEAT], [10, 32, 64, 64]]
       down_conv_nn: [[FEAT, 16, 32, 64], [64, 64, 128]]


* First convolution receives ``ratio=0.2``\ , ``radius=0.1``\ , ``local_nn_=[10, 8, 3]``\ , ``down_conv_nn=[3, 16, 32, 64]``
* Second convolution receives ``ratio=0.25``\ , ``radius=0.2``\ , ``local_nn_=[10, 32, 64, 64]``\ , ``down_conv_nn=[64, 64, 128]``
* Both of them will also receive a dictionary ``activation = {name: "LeakyReLU", negative_slope: 0.2}`` 



Launch an experiment
--------------------
Now that we have our new dataset and model, it is time to launch a training. If you have followed the instructions above you should
be able to simply run the following command and should run smoothly!

.. code-block::

    poetry run python run task=segmentation dataset=s3dis model_type=pointnet2 model_name=pointnet2_charlesmsg

Your terminal should contain:

.. image:: ../imgs/logging.png
   :target: ../imgs/logging.png
   :alt: logging
